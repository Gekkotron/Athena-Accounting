# Athena Accounting

Self-hosted personal accounting. Local-only, no cloud dependencies, your
bank data never leaves your network.

- Import OFX (SGML, Latin-1 or UTF-8) and French CSV statements
- Database-level deduplication on re-imports
- Configurable rule engine for automatic categorisation, with sign guards
  and accent/case-insensitive word matching
- Internal transfer detection (the two legs are linked and excluded
  from income/expense aggregates)
- Bulk "Tri" tab for the long tail of uncategorised transactions, with
  on-the-fly rule generation
- Multi-currency, multi-account, with opening-balance discipline
- Argon2id-hashed first-run onboarding; session cookie auth

## Stack

- **Backend:** Node 20 + Fastify 5 + TypeScript + Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (`pg_trgm`, `unaccent`, `pgcrypto`)
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind 3 + TanStack Query
- **Packaging:** single `docker-compose.yml` (postgres + backend + frontend)

## Quickstart

```sh
./install.sh                  # generates .env with strong random secrets
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> — the first visit walks you through creating
your username and password. Your password is hashed with argon2id
(per-user salt) before being stored; only the hash ever touches the
database.

Default host ports (both bound to `127.0.0.1`):

| Service  | Host port | Container port | Listener         |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| frontend | 8000      | 80 (nginx)     | all host IPs     |
| backend  | 8001      | 3000           | all host IPs     |
| postgres | 5432      | 5432           | 127.0.0.1 only   |

Frontend and backend listen on every host interface so other devices on your
LAN can reach the app (`http://<server-lan-ip>:8000`). Postgres stays bound
to loopback because the backend reaches it via the compose network — nothing
outside the host should touch it.

Override via `FRONTEND_PORT` / `BACKEND_PORT` in `.env`. Avoid 6000, 6665–6669,
and 6697 — Chrome blocks them as `ERR_UNSAFE_PORT`.

If you actually want the app to stay loopback-only (single-machine access),
prefix the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` with `127.0.0.1:`.

## Configuration env vars

`install.sh` writes random values for the secrets; you can edit `.env`
freely if you want to customise.

| Variable             | Default | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POSTGRES_USER`      | athena  | DB user.                                                                |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`  | random  | Generated.                                                              |
| `POSTGRES_DB`        | athena  | DB name.                                                                |
| `SESSION_SECRET`     | random  | ≥ 32 chars. Used to sign the session cookie.                            |
| `COOKIE_SECURE`      | false   | Set to `true` only behind an HTTPS-terminating reverse proxy.           |
| `FRONTEND_PORT`      | 8000    | Host port for the SPA.                                                  |
| `BACKEND_PORT`       | 8001    | Host port for the Fastify API.                                          |

## Importing a statement

1. Create the destination account in **Comptes** (the opening balance +
   opening date are mandatory — every reported balance is computed as
   `opening_balance + SUM(amount WHERE date >= opening_date)`).
2. *(Optional)* add filename patterns in the same tab so the importer
   resolves the target account automatically.
3. In **Imports**, upload your `.ofx` / `.qfx` / `.csv` file. The
   response surfaces inserted vs deduped counts — a "0 inserted" outcome
   on a re-import means the dedup keys matched, not that anything went
   wrong.

CSV format the parser expects:

- separator `;` (auto-detected, `,` also tried)
- decimal `,`
- dates `JJ/MM/AAAA`
- a date column, a label column, and either a `Montant` column or a
  `Débit` + `Crédit` pair (header names are matched accent/case-insensitively)

OFX: SGML-style (tags without closing tags) is handled, both
Windows-1252 and UTF-8 are detected from the OFX header.

## Internal transfers

Configure pairs of keywords in **Règles** → *(coming, transfer rules
endpoint is `/api/transfer-rules` — UI page will appear in v2 if you
need it)*. The importer annotates matching transactions, then looks for
the mirror leg in the counterpart account within ±7 days. Found legs
share a `transfer_group_id` and are excluded from income/expense
aggregates.

## Migrations

Hand-written SQL in `backend/src/db/migrations/*.sql`, applied in
lexicographic order at server boot, tracked in a `schema_migrations`
table. Each file runs in its own transaction; nothing skipped, nothing
re-run. You can also use `drizzle-kit` (`cd backend && npm run db:generate`)
to emit the next migration from `schema.ts`; the runner ignores the
journal file Drizzle creates alongside.

## Security notes

- Both services bind to `127.0.0.1` only — there's no public listener.
- Argon2id parameters meet the OWASP 2024 minimum (19 MiB memory, 2
  iterations, parallelism 1) and a per-user salt is generated by the library.
- Login always runs an argon2 verify, even when the user does not exist,
  to prevent username enumeration via response timing.
- Session id is rotated on login (anti-fixation).
- Onboarding endpoint refuses any request after the first user is
  created (anti-takeover).

## Roadmap

- [x] Étape 1 — Architecture + schema design
- [x] Étape 2 — docker-compose + schema + `/health`
- [x] Étape 3 — Auth + onboarding + accounts CRUD
- [x] Étape 4 — OFX/CSV parsers + dedup
- [x] Étape 5 — Rule engine + retroactive recategorization
- [x] Étape 6 — Internal transfer detection
- [x] Étape 7 — Transactions API + reports
- [x] Étape 8 — Frontend: layout + dashboard + transactions + accounts + imports
- [x] Étape 9 — "Tri des catégories" tab
- [x] Étape 10 — Categories/rules UI + README polish

## Possible next steps (v2)

- A `/transfer-rules` UI page (the API exists)
- Pie/bar charts on the dashboard (recharts or similar)
- Multi-currency conversion via a small manual FX-rate table
- Optional Ollama integration to suggest a category when no rule matches
  (LLM stays local, behind a feature flag, default off — per the original spec)
